# Customer_segmentation

In this project, my primary objective is to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their historical interactions with the grocery store. The aim is to scrutinize customer behavior and discern unique patterns within each group. Customer segmentation serves as a valuable tool, empowering the store to enhance sales by tailoring campaigns to specific customer segments.

The ultimate goal is to identify and target the most responsive groups, thereby increasing overall efficiency and effectiveness in reaching the intended audience.
